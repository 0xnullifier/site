Hey! I am Utkarsh

### About Me

I am Final year at IIT Roorkee majoring in Electronics engineering, passionate about software developement escpecially in the crypto space !
I love learning about zk-crytography, blockchains, distributed systems and large-scale software. I like learning new technologies and languages.

### Skills

The most important skill I posses is the ability to learn new things quickly. I can build anything even if I don't know the tech like AI or a new language.
I know most of the mainstream languages here are some which I have written code in rust, go, js, python, julia, ocaml etc.

### Projects & Experiences

Most of my experience comes from grants or building hackathon projects. I will mention the most notable one's.
