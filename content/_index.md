Yo! I am Utkarsh

## About Me

I am Pre-final year at IIT Roorkee majoring in Electronics engineering, passionate about software developement escpecially in the crypto space !
I love learning about zk-crytography , blockchains and distributed systems in general and large-scale software. Recently I have developed an interest in GPUs and hardware acceleration side of things. I like learning new technologies and languages.

## Skills

The most important skill I posses is the ability to learn new things quickly especially if I have to build something I am quite sure I can do it any language or tech stack even the one's I don't know. (I know this sounds arrogant but idk how else  I can say this)
I know most of the mainstream languages here are some which I have written code in rust, go, js, python, julia, ocaml etc.

## Experiences

Most of my experience comes from grants or building hackathon projects. I will mention the most notable one's.

- **NetZero**: is a proof of solvency platfrom on MINA protocol. This was a funded project under mina navigators program. You can see the [endpoint presentation](https://youtu.be/g3quUInW1OY?si=6jqX-L989Cpe1V1K).
- **StealthTradeDao**: was made at ETHSingapore 2024. It won first prize in Mina and also won the NEAR protocl track. It was private perpetuals platform on MINA protocol. Checkout the [showcase](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/stealthtradedao-8jt17).
- **Akashpay**: this was actually one of the first projects I made and introduced me to the world of web3 and thus I am adding it to my experiences. It was made for akahasthon2 hackathon and is a fiat onramp for akt token. It won first place in the deployment track. Here is the [submission](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/12768)

And few more hackathons that I have won are:

- First place in **Funding the Commons** *NEAR track* and Third place in the *FileCoin* Track for [VielNetFL](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/18948)
- First place in *Defi Track* of **MovementLabs Hackathons** for [MOVEx](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/14159)
- First place in *Defi Track* of **Archway hackathon** for [Mosaic Protocol](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13783)
- First place in **Fluence Track HackFS-2024** for [Key Shard](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/keyshard-odizm)
- Second place in **CalimeroxICP** for [Privitade](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/22715)

## Projects

These are projects I made most of them are in hacakthons but here are some cool one's:
